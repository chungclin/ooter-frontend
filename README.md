Ooter App's frontend consists of a few simple components composed in React-Native and using the Google Places autocomplete API.

The app allows you to find a rider or driver for your trip based on your destination and origin address and your search radius.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).
